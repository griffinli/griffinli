Welcome to my GitHub!

I co-founded [Polar](https://www.polar.cx) to automate tech support by finding answers from community forums. 
- [Polar V4](https://new.polar.cx)
  - Frontend: https://github.com/griffinli/polar-v4-frontend
  - ElasticSearch Import: https://github.com/griffinli/polar-v4-elastic
- [Polar V2](https://demo.polar.cx)
  - Frontend: https://github.com/griffinli/polar-v2
  - Backend: https://github.com/griffinli/polar-v2-api

I wrote the code linked above (frontends + backends). In prior iterations, my co-founder built the frontend while I handled the backend. 

I designed the landing page and implemented it in Webflow, and operated cloud infrastructure (AWS, Vercel, Render).

My second project was working on a search engine immune to SEO [(demos)](https://demo.nternet.xyz). Below is the source code of items on the demo website.
- Product experiments: https://github.com/griffinli/search-experiments
- Prototype One: https://github.com/griffinli/prototype-one

Last summer, I interned at [Beeper](https://github.com/beeper), where I built [Widgets](https://blog.beeper.com/p/build-widgets-with-beeper) and worked on self-hosting. See pinned repos.
